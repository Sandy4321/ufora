//TODO TESTS anybody: Create FORA tests around evaluating two equivalent functions.
//
//We could get a bunch of FORA value together and then produce a sequence of
//tests in which we claim that two pieces of FORA code both produce functions
//that do exactly the same thing. We could then verify that the outputs over
//the whole set of inputs were the same.  For instance, we could state that
//	fun ({Int64} x) { 0 } (x) { 1 }
//is the same as
//	fun (x) { if (Type(x) is Int64) 0 else 1 }
//this would be a more robust test of the pattern matching syntax than just
//writing a few examples out, especially for some more complex FORA
//functions.
